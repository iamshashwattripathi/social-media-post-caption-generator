# 📱 Social Media Post & Caption Generator

This project introduces a simple yet powerful AI-based tool that helps users create engaging social media content in just a few seconds. By entering a few keywords or a topic, the tool automatically generates **catchy captions**, **relevant hashtags**, and **emojis** that match the mood—all tailored to fit the style of the chosen platform.

Whether you're posting on **Instagram**, **LinkedIn**, or **Twitter (X)**, the tool adjusts the **tone**, **format**, and **content** to suit each platform’s unique audience.

It’s built using:
- 🤗 **Hugging Face Transformers** for natural language generation
